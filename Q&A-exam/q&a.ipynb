    "   An hash table, also kown as hash map, is a data structure (entity used for data organization, managment and storage) putting in corrispondence a key to a value. It is implemented through the hash function: it maps inputs in a fixed length output. It has to be deterministic, uniform in the output space (in order to avoid collisions and so differnt stuff giving the same output), fast to claculate and also hard to invert. That is particularly useful when we need to find the value linked to a particular key: without hashin, given a array of possible kyes matching the values positions in another array, we have to implement a serch algorithm in the keys array and then take the value corresonding in the other array. Instead, with an hash table we find the right value simply calculating a function. It is a tremendous save of time and it is useful for accessing quickly to a memory address or to navigate in direcion of a webste using an URL. In Python every immutable object (to modify them you have to create another object referring to another memory address) is hashable: strings, tuples and classes for example."

    "    In a <font color=\"coral\">CPU</font> there are <font color=\"coral\">few ALU</font>, a <font color=\"coral\">large control</font> and a <font color=\"coral\">large</font> caches: this architecture is ideal for <font color=\"coral\">Instruction Level Parallelism</font>. Instead, in a <font color=\"coral\">GPU</font> there are <font color=\"coral\">many cores</font> with <font color=\"coral\">limited caching</font> for speed in memory access and a <font color=\"coral\">small control</font> part: useful for <font color=\"coral\">Thread Level Parallelism</font>. In the case of <font color=\"coral\">CPU</font> there is the possibility of <font color=\"coral\">branch prediction</font> (guessing the outcome of a conditional operation and prepare for the most likely result), instead in the case of <font color=\"coral\">GPU</font> we have <font color=\"coral\">branch predication</font> (executing certain instructions if certain predicates are true) and the framework of <font color=\"coral\">Single Instruction Multiple Trheads</font>.\n",

    "13. **What is the SIMT / SIMD architecture?** \\\n",
    "    It is the architecture used in the <font color=\"coral\">GPUs</font>, in wich there are <font color=\"coral\">multiple processing elements</font> that perform the <font color=\"coral\">same operation</font> on multiple data points <font color=\"coral\">simultaneously</font>. (altro?)\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **How is CUDA programming structured?** \\\n",
    "    Cuda is a set of <font color=\"coral\">C/C++ extensions</font> to enable the GPU computing on <font color=\"coral\">NVIDIA GPUs</font>. It is an <font color=\"coral\">API</font> (inteface for the comunication between different components in the same computer or different machines) controlling the <font color=\"coral\">GPU behaviour</font>. The Cuda programming is organized in three steps;\n",
    "    - <font color=\"coral\">Copy data</font> from <font color=\"coral\">host</font> (refers CPU and its memory) to <font color=\"coral\">device</font> (resfres to Gpu and its memory).\n",
    "    - <font color=\"coral\">Copy</font> the <font color=\"coral\">kernel</font> (a C/C++ script containing a function starting the \\_\\_global__ declaration with he specification of operations and threads) and <font color=\"coral\">execute</font> it.\n",
    "    - <font color=\"coral\">Copy back</font> the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **What is meant by coalescent memory access?** \\\n",
    "    It means <font color=\"coral\">accessing</font> an entire <font color=\"coral\">section of memory</font> and not a single location at one time. Each section called <font color=\"coral\">burst</font> is passed to the processor. It is particulary useful when more threads run the same operation over data in consecutive memory locations in the global memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Describe the main methods for using GPUs in Python with PyCuda** \\\n",
    "    There are <font color=\"coral\">three methods</font> to use PyCuda:\n",
    "    - The <font color=\"coral\">simple one</font> is to organize the data in <font color=\"coral\">GPU arrays</font> and simply use the <font color=\"coral\">operation symbol</font> (easy case) to perform the instruction (the kernel is inside PyCuda). Low performances.\n",
    "    - The <font color=\"coral\">medium method</font> is to use the <font color=\"coral\">elementwise method</font>. The <font color=\"coral\">istances</font> of the class <font color=\"coral\">ElementwiseKernel</font> define a <font color=\"coral\">callable kernel</font>. Only <font color=\"coral\">single line instruction</font> can be used and the performances are not at the best.\n",
    "    - The <font color=\"coral\">hard one</font> is to use to use <font color=\"coral\">SourceModule</font>. It allows to define ad use a <font color=\"coral\">personalized generic kenel</font>. Top performances\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In every case data (vectors) must be previously copied on the GPU."
